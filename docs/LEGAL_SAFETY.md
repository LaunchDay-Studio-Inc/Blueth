# Blueth Legal Safety Checklist

This is a practical checklist, not legal advice.

## Trademark/Copyright Safety Rules Applied

- Original game name (`Blueth`) and character naming.
- Original artwork and original generated audio included in-repo.
- No copied logos, icons, UI layouts, fonts, sprites, SFX, or code from other games.
- Genre-inspired mechanics only at high level (arena survival loop).
- Differentiated feature added: movement-powered `Flow Surge` plus distinct weapon archetypes.

## Pre-Launch Review

- Verify no third-party assets were copied into `assets/`.
- Verify store copy avoids references to specific competing trademarks.
- Verify no claims of affiliation with other studios/titles.
- Keep records showing original asset creation in this repository.

## Optional Hardening

- Run a final legal review for naming/marketing copy in target regions.
- Register your own trademark if long-term brand protection is planned.
